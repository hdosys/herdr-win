# AGENT_IMPROVEMENTS.md

Evidence-backed proposals for making future herdr-win agent work faster, cheaper,
safer, or more reliable.

This is not product backlog or task history. Product work belongs in `BACKLOG.md`;
user-visible behavior in `PRODUCT.md`; repository-specific technical design in
`ARCHITECTURE.md`; accepted herdr-win-specific agent rules in `AGENTS.md` or
procedure in `CONTRIBUTING.md`; cross-project workflow in the global OpenCode
configuration repository.

## Rules

- Add only concrete proposals likely to help future work.
- Keep entries short and evidence-based.
- Merge duplicates instead of appending repeats.
- Do not include secrets, credentials, private data, transient process IDs, logs,
  transcripts, generated evidence, or product feature requests.
- Status values: proposed, accepted, declined, done.

## Proposals

- **Status: proposed. Add a repository-owned Windows mailbox replay helper.**
  Evidence: this milestone repeated manual `worktree`/`format-patch` commands,
  encountered linked-worktree safe-directory errors, and required a second cleanup
  path after Git hit Windows path-length limits. Proposed change: add one bounded
  helper that creates a task worktree, folds one logical mailbox, verifies its
  patch, and removes it with long-path support. Expected benefit: fewer recovery
  branches, safer cleanup, and faster repeatable mailbox refreshes. Owner:
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` plus the future helper and focused tests.
