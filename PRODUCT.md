# PRODUCT.md

## Purpose

This file is the short durable user-perspective truth for herdr-win: the fork's
product promise, visible Windows-specific behavior, terminology, supported choices,
and acceptance outcomes. Upstream Herdr owns general product behavior; code and
tests remain the detailed implementation truth.

## Product Shape and Identity

- herdr-win is an unofficial, upstream-first Windows distribution of Herdr, not a
  separate product line. It exists to advance Herdr's Windows support through a
  small patch set designed to remain reviewable and suitable for upstream.
- Fork identity appears in repository, release, update-feed, Windows setup, and
  Installed Apps presentation. The Windows package entry is **Herdr Win**; the
  executable, command, configuration, state, sessions, sockets, and protocol remain
  `herdr` and stay compatible with upstream.
- A published `herdr --version` reports `herdr-win <CalVer> (Herdr
  <upstream-version>)`. A separately built local binary instead reports
  `herdr-win local (Herdr <upstream-version>, build <build-id>)` when build
  provenance is available, and omits the build clause otherwise. Integrations can
  require the stable `herdr-win ` prefix without changing the executable, command,
  state, or protocol identity.
- herdr-win snapshots currently target Windows x86_64. General CLI, TUI,
  configuration, integration, and issue behavior remains documented and owned
  upstream unless a maintained Windows delta explicitly changes it.
- The maintained user-visible Windows delta covers terminal fidelity, remote
  attach/image transport, managed Windows distribution, and truthful OpenCode
  retry/error lifecycle reporting.

## Installation, Update, and Uninstall

- The normal managed installation is per-user under
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Herdr`, places its stable `bin` directory first on user
  `PATH` when no effective equivalent is already present, never claims or rewrites
  an equivalent user-owned entry, and otherwise shadows without changing any
  existing upstream/native `herdr`. It registers **Herdr Win** in Windows Installed
  Apps without requiring administrator
  privileges. The installer interface is English-only. Its branded,
  keyboard-operable Windows setup uses the human-facing display name **Herdr Win**
  consistently while the repository and release slug remains `herdr-win`. Welcome
  and Finish include the current reviewed Herdr base version. Setup identifies the
  fork as an unofficial distribution built from the latest reviewed stable Herdr
  release plus the maintained Windows
  patches. The destination remains fixed without displaying a path or offering a
  directory choice on Welcome. Setup presents the Apache-2.0 license before modifying
  files and ends with the exact first command plus separate user-invoked links to the
  fork guide and official upstream project. It never opens Herdr or a browser
  automatically. The installed payload and portable ZIP include the same license as
  `LICENSE.txt`. A portable ZIP remains a supported manual alternative.
- The managed installer copies upstream's canonical Herdr skill to
  `%USERPROFILE%\.agents\skills\herdr\SKILL.md`. When Claude Code is detected,
  it also copies the skill below `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` or
  `%USERPROFILE%\.claude`. Install/update creates a missing copy and replaces only
  a `SKILL.md` whose bytes match a current or historical installer-delivered
  version. A customized or otherwise unknown copy is preserved and setup reports a
  visible warning; every sibling file and directory is always preserved.
- The managed installation has exactly one launcher at `bin\herdr.exe`. It starts
  the selected immutable runtime payload directly; runtime directories never carry
  a second launcher. Setup replaces the launcher immediately when idle or stages a
  replacement whose hash and embedded build ID are validated before publication
  after the final managed payload exits. Every retained release candidate has a
  distinct runtime build ID, including retries or independent builds from unchanged
  source, so byte-different payloads never compete for one immutable runtime path.
- Setup updates only an exact current managed installation. Any other existing
  install layout, including the former runtime-local launcher design, is preserved
  and rejected with instructions to uninstall the existing **Herdr** or **Herdr Win**
  entry from Windows Installed Apps before running setup again; setup never
  migrates, backs up, or removes an incompatible layout. Within a registered current
  installation, setup normally recreates missing installer control files and
  replaces changed regular control-file bytes. If current-format drift cannot use
  that narrow repair, setup directly rebuilds the dedicated managed root from its
  validated embedded payload after proving that no managed process or lease is
  active. Reparse points and active installed files remain preserved blockers;
  user configuration and projects remain outside this root. A current managed root
  remains updateable when its Installed Apps registration is absent or uses the
  immediately preceding current value set; setup safely defaults a missing PATH
  value-ownership fact to unowned and rewrites the complete current registration.
  Before setup adds its exact PATH entry it persists one ownership-intent marker;
  Installed Apps registration finalizes that ownership. An interrupted setup
  therefore claims the fixed literal managed path while pre-existing equivalent
  user entries remain unowned. On uninstall it removes every normalized literal
  spelling of that fixed path, including case, slash, quote, or trailing-separator
  variants, so no dead managed-path alias remains. Environment expressions and
  foreign entries remain preserved. The intent also
  records whether setup created the user `PATH` value itself, so uninstall restores
  an originally absent value as absent instead of leaving an empty registry value.
  Exact rooted literal entries may contain `%`; expandable entries such as
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\...` remain foreign and are never removed as installer-owned.
- Installed/current after setup and absent after uninstall are the terminal product
  outcomes. Fresh/update sibling directories are private disposable staging, not a
  second ownership or recovery authority; stale or malformed staging is removed
  when safe and otherwise preserved with a warning without blocking the requested
  operation. One stable Windows named mutex serializes setup, update, and uninstall
  by acquired ownership, including recovery from an abandoned owner. Uninstall uses
  that lifecycle mutex and the existing launcher lock plus one
  `uninstall.pending` launch gate, then atomically moves `bin` and immutable runtimes
  into disposable same-parent staging before final metadata/self-cleanup. A stopped
  removal therefore leaves either the complete owned directory or no directory in
  the managed root, never a partially deleted tree. The marker remains the final
  filesystem ownership sentinel until residual enumeration succeeds. Final cleanup
  removes it before the retry executables, so an interruption either retains a
  complete retry root or leaves an exact cleanup residual that the next setup can
  finish. Any reported filesystem, PATH, or Installed Apps failure restores exact
  retry commands and installer-owned registration, so direct and silent retries may
  resume from the remaining root without parsing a separate uninstall journal.
  While the marker is present, the stable launcher refuses to start a new managed
  session.
- Direct setup and portable installs update through only the fork-owned immutable
  setup asset and verified digest through the fork-owned update feed. Existing
  managed sessions continue on their current runtime; a newer runtime may remain
  staged until old sessions exit,
  after which future launches switch atomically. The post-exit maintenance path
  then publishes any pending launcher and removes every exact unleased runtime
  except Active and optional Pending. Busy or ambiguous content is preserved and
  reported. A hard process-tree kill leaves pending state recoverable for the next
  safe launch or setup. Update never terminates active Herdr sessions.
- The installed distribution owns its update feed. A herdr-win binary has no
  user-selectable stable/preview channel or `update.channel` setting and cannot be
  redirected to official Herdr update sources. CalVer `YYYY.MM.DD.N` orders fork
  releases: a published binary accepts only a newer feed CalVer, while a local
  build may install the latest published release. The runtime build ID remains the
  exact immutable payload and matching remote-asset identity, upstream Cargo
  SemVer remains plugin/provenance compatibility metadata, and the wire protocol
  remains the client/server compatibility gate.
- A copy installed by WinGet updates only through
  `winget upgrade --id hdosys.herdr-win --exact --source winget`; `herdr update`
  refuses to replace package-managed bytes. A newer GitHub release does not create
  an update badge or release-note action for that copy until the official WinGet
  source exposes the exact target release version; then user-facing update actions
  show the WinGet command. Running direct setup over the exact current managed root
  preserves existing WinGet ownership rather than creating competing update paths.
  Uninstall removes that ownership with the managed program.
- Uninstall requires managed sessions to be closed and never terminates them. It
  removes the managed program, only literal spellings of its own user `PATH` path, **Herdr Win** Installed
  Apps registration, and installer-known `SKILL.md` copies at its managed universal
  and Claude locations. Its single skill-removal checkbox covers both locations and
  starts selected only when every existing copy is installer-known or absent; any
  unknown copy leaves it clear. Selecting it explicitly authorizes removal of the
  exact `SKILL.md` files even when customized. Silent uninstall removes known copies
  automatically, preserves unknown copies by default, and accepts `/REMOVE_SKILL`
  as explicit authorization. Other PATH entries and skill-directory content are
  preserved, so a previously shadowed upstream/native `herdr` becomes visible to
  new processes again. A `herdr` skill directory is removed only immediately after
  its authorized `SKILL.md` removal proves it empty. The separate interactive
  settings checkbox preserves configuration and session data under
  `%USERPROFILE%\.herdr` by default; silent uninstall accepts `/REMOVE_SETTINGS` as
  the explicit settings-deletion choice. If locked or unsafe content prevents that
  selected cleanup or a selected installer-managed skill removal from finishing,
  uninstall preserves and reports the residual while still removing the managed
  program, Installed Apps registration, and its installer-owned `PATH` entry.
- The executable and setup are currently unsigned. Documentation must keep the
  SmartScreen warning and digest-verification path clear until signing becomes an
  explicit release capability.

## Interaction and Status

- Keyboard-first terminal operation remains complete end to end.
- Every supported client can attach to an x86_64 or ARM64 Windows SSH host. Herdr
  first uses an exact version- and protocol-matching `herdr.exe` from that SSH
  user's `PATH` or its versioned per-user sidecar. If neither matches, an
  interactive attach offers to transfer the complete digest-verified Windows
  portable ZIP into that user's profile without running the managed installer or
  changing `PATH`; an ordinary non-interactive attach never modifies the host.
- `herdr --remote <target> --provision` is the explicit configuration-management
  path. Unattended use requires `--yes` and may add `--json`. It deploys a matching
  binary, rejects invalid remote configuration before server activation, starts a
  missing server, reloads configuration when the running binary already matches,
  and saves then restarts only when binary activation requires it. A non-package-
  managed local Windows x86_64 build can provision itself to x86_64 or ARM64
  Windows through Windows emulation. Windows remote hosts do not support live
  handoff.
- User-visible state distinguishes waiting, active, mixed, complete, failed,
  cancelled, stopped, and no-op outcomes whenever they require different user
  understanding or action.
- Status inspection is observational: viewing status never starts, retries, or
  changes work.

## Release Promise

- Published snapshot assets are the exact retained outputs of one successful manual
  candidate build of the selected upstream source plus the maintained queue.
  Promotion never rebuilds or repackages them. The portable ZIP, managed installer,
  and manifest digest identify the same source.
- Each snapshot also includes raw Linux and macOS executables for amd64 and arm64,
  built from that same candidate for remote endpoints that require the matching wire
  protocol. Windows x86_64 remains the managed distribution target.
- Each release has a manually selected herdr-win CalVer `YYYY.MM.DD.N` and is based
  on the exact latest upstream stable release selected during the most recent
  explicit refresh. Updater-facing tags and assets retain
  `herdr-win_v<CalVer>_<os>_<arch>.<ext>` and `_setup.exe`; the GitHub release title,
  notes, and installer metadata visibly pair that CalVer with `Herdr
  v<upstream-version>`. Source/control hashes remain exact provenance.
- Candidate builds and release promotion are separate manual operations. A build
  requires the intended CalVer, uses the reviewed stable commit recorded in `BASE`,
  and retains its candidate artifacts for 14 days without publishing a release.
  Promotion requires that successful build's workflow run ID and publishes only its
  validated artifacts. An explicit manual refresh separately selects the latest
  non-draft, non-prerelease upstream release and replays the complete queue; no
  scheduled workflow queries, rebases, builds, or publishes current upstream.
- Ordinary pushes do not publish binaries. A replay, build, package, immutability,
  digest, or feed-verification failure prevents or visibly fails the corresponding
  release stage rather than silently publishing a different build.
