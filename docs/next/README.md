# herdr-win

**A native Windows distribution of [Herdr](https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr), maintained as a small, reviewable patch queue, not a permanent fork.**

`herdr-win` is an unofficial, upstream-first delivery lane for Herdr on Windows. It keeps the normal `herdr` command and workflow, adds Windows behavior not yet available in an upstream stable release, and publishes tested snapshots from an exact reviewed Herdr release plus the ordered maintained patch queue.

> [!NOTE]
> Upstream Herdr owns the general CLI, configuration, integrations, and product documentation. This repository owns only its Windows-focused delta and distribution. Reproduce general issues with upstream Herdr before reporting them here.

## Why it exists

Herdr already runs on Windows, but a good Windows release needs more than a binary that compiles. Terminal fidelity, remote attachment, safe packaging, updates, and native verification all need clear ownership.

This repository provides that focused delivery path:

- **Useful Windows behavior now:** fixes can ship without turning the fork into a separate product.
- **A visible delta:** every retained change belongs to one reviewable mailbox instead of disappearing into branch history.
- **An upstream route:** code that lands upstream is removed from the queue rather than maintained twice.
- **Reproducible snapshots:** source, patch order, build identity, artifacts, and SHA-256 digests stay connected.

## What differs from upstream

The table is intentionally capability-level. The patch files contain the exact implementation and tests.

| Area | Status | What this repository contributes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Native ConPTY foundation | ✅ **Upstreamed in Herdr v0.6.9** | Herdr v0.8.0 added the modern app-local ConPTY packaging that herdr-win now reuses instead of carrying a duplicate foundation. |
| Terminal fidelity | **Maintained here** · [`0001`](https://github.com/hdosys/herdr-win/blob/master/patches/delta/0001-windows-terminal-appearance.patch) | Windows appearance, color and cursor fidelity, rendering, and VTI input behavior. |
| Windows remote attach and image bridge | **Partly merged upstream after v0.8.0, release pending** · [#2329](https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr/pull/2329) · [`0003`](https://github.com/hdosys/herdr-win/blob/master/patches/delta/0003-windows-remote-attach.patch) | Upstream master now includes Windows client attach to Linux/macOS and the image bridge. herdr-win retains Windows remote-host attach and additional named-pipe/backpressure coverage until the next stable refresh minimizes the mailbox. |
| Managed Windows snapshots | **Maintained here** · [`0004`](https://github.com/hdosys/herdr-win/blob/master/patches/delta/0004-windows-managed-distribution.patch) | Verified Windows packages, per-user setup, portable archives, package-manager update ownership, and safe runtime handoff. |
| OpenCode lifecycle reporting | **Maintained here** · [`0005`](https://github.com/hdosys/herdr-win/blob/master/patches/delta/0005-opencode-retry-notifications.patch) | Retry-aware status correlation so active retries stay quiet and terminal failures remain visible. |
| Runtime downloads | **Maintained here** · [`0006`](https://github.com/hdosys/herdr-win/blob/master/patches/delta/0006-harden-curl-transfers.patch) | Cross-platform `curl` transfers ignore user configuration and permit only bounded TLS 1.2+ HTTPS requests and redirects. |

Upstream PR #2329 merged after v0.8.0 and has not shipped in a stable release yet. Mailbox `0003` therefore remains in the current queue; at the next stable refresh, it can shrink to Windows-host attach and the additional bridge hardening. The original implementation builds on [nsxdavid's `feat/windows-remote-attach` work](https://github.com/nsxdavid/herdr/tree/feat/windows-remote-attach).

## Sister project: Herdr Sandbox

herdr-win is developed and validated with [**Herdr Sandbox**](https://github.com/hdosys/herdr-sandbox), a disposable native Windows development environment for coding agents. It provides the clean Windows toolchains and realistic native boundary used to build and test this fork; it is a sister project, not a runtime dependency.

## How the patch queue works

```

[`patches/delta/BASE`](https://github.com/hdosys/herdr-win/blob/master/patches/delta/BASE) records the exact upstream stable commit. [`series`](https://github.com/hdosys/herdr-win/blob/master/patches/delta/series) is the only application order. Each patch is a full-index, binary-safe mailbox with one logical responsibility.

An upstream refresh is deliberate: select the latest stable release, replay the complete queue, remove behavior upstream now owns, regenerate changed mailboxes, and verify a fresh replay. `BASE` never follows upstream `master` automatically.

## Install

Windows x86_64 is the managed distribution target. Each release also carries matching Linux and macOS binaries for remote endpoints that must speak the same wire protocol.

### Setup (recommended)

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hdosys/herdr-win/master/docs/assets/herdr-win-setup-welcome.png" alt="Herdr Win setup welcome page">
</p>

Download the newest `herdr-win_v<version>_windows_amd64_setup.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/hdosys/herdr-win/releases) and run it. Setup installs for the current user without administrator access, adds `herdr` to the user `PATH`, and registers an uninstaller. Open a new terminal and run:

```powershell
herdr --version
herdr
```

Published builds report `herdr-win <CalVer> (Herdr <upstream-version>)`. Local test builds include their build ID when available, as in `herdr-win local (Herdr <upstream-version>, build <build-id>)`, and omit that clause otherwise. Integrations can use the stable `herdr-win ` prefix to identify this distribution and its Windows-specific features.

The installed distribution owns its update feed. herdr-win has no user-selectable update channel and cannot be redirected to official Herdr update sources through config. CalVer orders fork releases, the build ID identifies the exact immutable runtime and matching remote assets, and the wire protocol gates client/server compatibility.

Running a newer setup over a current managed installation updates it in place and repairs incomplete current installer registration.

For setup downloaded directly from Releases, use `herdr update` from an ordinary terminal after detaching from active Herdr sessions. Updates preserve running sessions and activate the new verified snapshot when it is safe. A WinGet-owned installation instead updates through:

```powershell
winget upgrade --id hdosys.herdr-win --exact --source winget
```

GitHub may publish a snapshot before the WinGet catalog finishes accepting it. A WinGet-owned copy shows an update only after the official `winget` source contains that exact release version, so its update action always points to installable bytes.

Uninstall from **Windows Settings → Apps → Installed apps**. Settings are preserved unless you explicitly choose to remove them. Uninstall never terminates active Herdr sessions or removes unowned or unsafe content; it stops or preserves the blocked residue and explains the required action.

### Verify the download

GitHub records a SHA-256 digest for every immutable release asset. Before running setup, verify the downloaded file against the `digest` for the same filename in that tagged release's GitHub metadata.

### Portable Windows ZIP

The release also includes `herdr-win_v<version>_windows_amd64.zip`. Extract the complete archive into one directory and run `herdr.exe`.

> [!WARNING]
> The Herdr executable and setup are currently unsigned, so Windows may show a SmartScreen warning. Download release artifacts only from this repository.

### Matching Linux and macOS binaries

Each release includes raw `linux_amd64`, `linux_arm64`, `macos_amd64`, and `macos_arm64` executables. They are compatibility companions for remote hosts, not managed installers.

Use matching binaries from the same herdr-win release on every endpoint. Independently released official builds are not guaranteed to use the same wire protocol.

For general commands, configuration, and agent integrations, use the [official Herdr documentation](https://herdr.dev/docs/).

## For upstream maintainers

Thank you for the native Windows foundation and the remote-client work merged in [#2329](https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr/pull/2329). herdr-win exists to make remaining Windows behavior easy to inspect, test, and remove from this fork as equivalent support lands upstream. The Windows remote-host follow-up is tracked in [Discussion #2409](https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr/discussions/2409).

The five files in `patches/delta/series` are the complete maintained product delta. Each is self-contained, so its behavior does not need to be reconstructed from this fork's development history.

1. Start at the exact commit in [`BASE`](https://github.com/hdosys/herdr-win/blob/master/patches/delta/BASE).
2. Apply [`series`](https://github.com/hdosys/herdr-win/blob/master/patches/delta/series) in order with `git am --3way`.
3. Review each mailbox as one responsibility-oriented change with its implementation, tests, and documentation.
4. Follow [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/hdosys/herdr-win/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to reproduce the replay and verification gates.

The mailboxes are offered as focused evidence and acceptance tests, not an all-or-nothing merge request. Upstream can split or reimplement them along its own ownership boundaries; once equivalent behavior ships, herdr-win removes it. Fork branding, release workflows, and publication state stay outside the product queue.

## Maintaining the project

Refresh and release are intentionally separate manual operations:

- **Refresh:** select and review a stable upstream release, then replay and minimize the queue.
- **Build:** replay recorded `BASE`, run the complete gates, and retain one candidate with provenance and checksums.
- **Promote:** publish those exact retained bytes without rebuilding or repackaging them.

Ordinary pushes do not publish binaries.
